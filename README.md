ExcelDemocracy: Creative Performance Dashboard
This repository contains the proof-of-concept project for "ExcelDemocracy," designed to demonstrate how creative data can be transformed into clear, actionable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The project includes a mock data generator, a machine learning model for conversion prediction, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard for visualization.

Key Components
mockdata2.py: A Python script that acts as a "data factory," generating the three synthetic CSV files required for the analysis.

jupyterfile.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that details the entire machine learning experiment. It handles data loading, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning (with Optuna), and the training of the final XGBoost conversion model. It saves the trained model for use in the dashboard.

dashboards.py: The main Streamlit application. It provides an interactive dashboard to explore the data and the model's predictions, including KPIs like ROAS, CAC, Payback Period, and a predictive Lift Forecast.

requirements.txt: A list of all the Python dependencies required to run this project.

conversion_model.joblib: The saved, pre-trained XGBoost model artifact generated by the Jupyter Notebook.

model_features.joblib: A saved list of the features the model was trained on, ensuring consistency between training and inference.

How to Run
Follow these steps in order to set up and run the project locally.

1. Install Dependencies
First, install all the necessary Python libraries from the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Generate Mock Data
Run the data factory script to create the campaigns.csv, sessions.csv, and orders.csv files.

python mockdata2.py

3. Train the ML Model
Open and run all the cells in the jupyterfile.ipynb notebook. This will perform the analysis and, most importantly, create the conversion_model.joblib and model_features.joblib files that the dashboard depends on.

4. Launch the Dashboard
Finally, run the Streamlit application.

streamlit run dashboards.py

Your web browser should automatically open with the interactive dashboard.

File Structure
The project uses a simple, flat structure. All key files are located in the root directory.
