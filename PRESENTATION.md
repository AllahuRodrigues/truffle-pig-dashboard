## ðŸ“Š Interactive Dashboard
**Live Dashboard**: [Your Streamlit URL will be here after deployment]

## ðŸ““ Jupyter Notebook Analysis
**Interactive Notebook**: [Your Binder/Colab URL will be here after deployment]

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo Walkthrough

### 1. Data Generation
Run `mockupdata.py` to generate synthetic campaign, session, and order data:
```bash
python3 mockupdata.py
```

### 2. Model Training
Execute the Jupyter notebook to train the machine learning model:
- Open `JupyterFile.ipynb` in Jupyter/Binder/Colab
- Run all cells to train the XGBoost conversion prediction model
- This creates `conversion_model.joblib` and `model_features.joblib`

### 3. Dashboard Exploration
Use the Streamlit app to explore results:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
